Hamiltonian Cycle in Assembly
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Hamiltonian Cycle check written in Assembly language. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basics of graph traversal and the Hamiltonian Cycle problem in a low-level programming environment. The Hamiltonian Cycle problem is a classic NP-complete problem in graph theory, which aims to determine whether a cycle exists in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

While this example operates on a minimal 2x2 adjacency matrix, it provides an introductory look at how complex graph algorithms can be approached using Assembly. This implementation showcases the fundamentals of working with adjacency matrices and basic conditional logic in Assembly language.
